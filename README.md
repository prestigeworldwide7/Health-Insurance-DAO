# Health Insurance DAO on Solana
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for providing health insurance services using the Solana blockchain.

## Overview
This project implements a Health Insurance DAO where members can:
- Join the DAO
- Submit claims for health-related expenses
- Participate in governance through proposals and voting
- Engage in dispute resolution processes
- Manage financial aspects like premiums and payouts
- Ensure compliance with KYC/AML and regulatory standards

## Features
- **Membership**: Members can join by connecting their Solana wallet.
- **Claims Management**: Process for submitting and verifying health insurance claims.
- **Governance**: Proposals can be made and voted on by members holding governance tokens.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanism for members to raise disputes over claims or decisions.
- **Financial Management**: Handles premium payments, treasury management, and claim payouts.
- **Compliance**: Implements basic KYC/AML checks and regulatory compliance rules.
- **Security & Privacy**: Ensures transactions and data handling are secure and private.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Version 14 or higher recommended.
- **Solana CLI**: Install the Solana CLI:
  ```bash
  sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.14.17/install)"
  ```
- **Rust**: If not installed, follow the [installation instructions for Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prestigeworldwide7/health-insurance-dao.git
   cd health-insurance-dao
   ```
2. Install dependencies for the smart contract:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Install dependencies for the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Smart Contract Development
- **Deploy Smart Contract**:
  ```bash
  solana program deploy path/to/your/program.so
  ```
- **Interact with the DAO**: Use the Solana CLI or integrate with a wallet like Phantom using `@solana/web3.js` or `@project-serum/anchor`.

### Frontend
- **Start the Development Server**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This command will run your frontend development server, typically on `localhost:3000`.
- **Connect Wallet**: Use the wallet adapter in the frontend to connect your Solana wallet.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests for Smart Contracts**:
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```
- **Frontend Tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Project Structure
- `/program`: Contains the Solana smart contract code.
- `/frontend`: React application for the user interface.
- `/tests`: Test scripts for both smart contracts and frontend.
